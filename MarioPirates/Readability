The code generally is highly readable. It disscuss all the states of mario has. The code divided into many parts according 
to the initial state mario at. Such as when mario is couching, when mario is right jumping and when mario is idle and facing
right, etc. Every states and how it use Icommand is highly readable.
However, when I first access the code, since there is lack of comments, it is a little confuse about why it discuss every state 
according to mario's initial state.
